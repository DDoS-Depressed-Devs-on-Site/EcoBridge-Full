# 🌱 EcoBridge Blockchain Node

**EcoBridge-Blockchain-Node** is a simple blockchain network simulation designed for testing and educational purposes. It demonstrates peer-to-peer communication between two nodes and maintains a decentralized history of donation records.

## 📦 Features

- ⛓️ Basic blockchain simulation
- 🔁 Two nodes communicate with each other
- 📜 Donation records stored and synchronized
- 🧾 Full history of all donations maintained

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
